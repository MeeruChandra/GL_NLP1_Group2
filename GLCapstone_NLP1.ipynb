    "## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n",
    "\n",
    "**DOMAIN**: Industrial safety. NLP based Chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CONTEXT:** \n",
    "The  database  comes  from one  of  the  biggest  industry  in  Brazil  and  in  the  world.  It  is  an  urgent  need  for  industries/companies  around  the globe to understand why employees still suffer some injuries/accidents in plants. Sometimes they also die in such environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DATA DESCRIPTION:**\n",
    "This  The  database  is  basically  records  of  accidents  from12  different  plants  in  03  different  countrieswhich  every  line  in  the  data  is  an occurrence of an accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns description:** \n",
    "- `Data`: timestamp or time/date information\n",
    "- `Countries`: which country the accident occurred (anonymised)\n",
    "- `Local`: the city where the manufacturing plant is located (anonymised)\n",
    "- `Industry sector`: which sector the plant belongs to\n",
    "- `Accident level`: from I to VI, it registers how severe was the accident (I means not severe but VI means very severe)\n",
    "- `Potential Accident Level`: Depending on the Accident Level, the database also registers how severe the accident could have been (due to other factors involved in the accident)\n",
    "- `Genre`: if the person is male of female\n",
    "- `Employee or Third Party`: if the injured person is an employee or a third party\n",
    "- `Critical Risk`: some description of the risk involved in the accident\n",
    "- `Description`: Detailed description of how the accident happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROJECT OBJECTIVE:**\n",
    "Design  a  ML/DL  based  chatbot  utility  which  can  help  the  professionals  to  highlight  the  safety  risk  as  per  the  incident description."
